# Snake in Golang


## How can I run this game?
In order to run this game, you can just use the makefile command **make run** for the default setting that we've established, or you can run the game as **go run main.go (number of food dots) (number of enemies).

An example of this would be *go run main.go 30 5*.

```
make run
go run main.go 30 5
```

**__IN ORDER TO USE THE SECOND COMMAND, YOU NEED TO HAVE INSTALLED THE EBITEN LIBRARY BEFOREHAND__**

You can do this by using the command:
```
go get -v github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten
```
